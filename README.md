### Game instructions:

## Overview
- The goal is to conquer all provinces belonging to other players.
- The top bar shows the player name and all resources that can be used.
- The lower bar shows information about a selected province, army, upgrade or battle. 
- You can buy upgrades by clicking on "Upgrades" in the top right corner.
- Resources are generated by scavanging and by buildings in the province, you can construct more buildings by clicking on one of the building buttons - mind that you can only construct one building in a province at a time.
- Scavanging happens automatically, how much resources that is scavanged depends on the size of the workforce in the province - so be careful when raising armies since this will drain the existing workforce!

## Armies
- You can raise an army by selecting a province and choosing "raise army" in the lower bar.
- You can merge two armies within a province by dragging one upon another.
- You can split an army by selecting it and choosing "split" in the lower bar.
- You can move an army to a friendly or enemy province by simply dragging it across the screen, notice that you can only drag an army to a neighbouring province.
NOTE: You can stop a movement by dragging the army into its current province, or change it by simply move it into another province. 
- You can see the status of a battle by clicking on the two swords clashing above a province. The more the slider moves to the right, the more likely that the attacker is going to win. 
NOTE: Both terrain and the level of fortifications in a province affect the damage your soldiers do in battle.
